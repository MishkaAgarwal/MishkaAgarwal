ABOUT ME: 
 	Hello! I’m Mishka Agarwal
 	I just started learning Python at school, and I'm already loving it!
 	Books are my favourite pastime—I could read for hours. I'm also into solving puzzles and murder mysteries. And don’t even get me started on my love for board games!
 	I love playing high strategy games such as the Great Western Trail, The Castles of Burgandy, and a lot more.
 	Math? Totally my thing.
 	Girl boss vibes.
 	My motto: Focus.
 	I live by the quote, "The key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles." It urges me to keep going forward, with a positive mood and mindset, and reminds me to leave behind the bad things in life.
 	I’m always in for some help and feedback!
