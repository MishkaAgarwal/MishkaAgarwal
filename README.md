ABOUT ME:<br> 
 	Hello! I’m Mishka Agarwal.<br>
 	I just started learning Python at school, and I'm already loving it!<br>
 	Books are my favourite pastime—I could read for hours. I'm also into solving puzzles and murder mysteries. And don’t even get me started on my love for board games!<br>
 	I love playing high strategy games such as the Great Western Trail, The Castles of Burgandy, and a lot more.<br>
 	Math? Totally my thing.<br>
 	Girl boss vibes.<br>
 	My motto: Focus.<br>
 	I live by the quote, "The key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles." It urges me to keep going forward, with a positive mood and mindset, and reminds me to leave behind the bad things in life.<br>
 	I’m always in for some help and feedback!<br>
